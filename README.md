# Key's Tiling Compositor

Very much a WIP, this "compositor" currently only handles the most basic wayland protocols.
Right now, it's capable of opening a wayland display server, having wayland apps connect to it and handle some events without crashing.

I'm using smithay, but I plan to move away from it in the future.
